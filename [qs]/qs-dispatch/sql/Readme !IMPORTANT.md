## Important Note on utf8mb4_unicode_ci.sql Execution

Please only execute the `utf8mb4_unicode_ci.sql` file if you encounter a console error that indicates an issue closely related to this. The specific execution of this SQL script is intended to address certain database character set compatibility issues. Running it without encountering the specified error may not be necessary and could affect your database setup inadvertently.

In case you see an error message in your console that seems to be about character set or collation conflicts, such as anything mentioning "utf8mb4" or "unicode_ci", then proceeding with the execution of `utf8mb4_unicode_ci.sql` is the recommended step to resolve the issue.

Always ensure you have a backup of your database before making any changes, to prevent any unintended data loss.
